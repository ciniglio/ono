v0.1: Barely Usable
===================

Basic REPL:
	 scan [folder] 						         => scans folder recursively for music
	 numfiles               				     => prints out number of files in db
	 search "free text"	    					 => does a free-text search in db
	 search artist:"El-P" track:"True Story"	 => does a specific track resolve

v0.2: Something decent
======================
Zeroconf: receive Tomahawk broadcasts, send out broadcasts
Tomahawk Protocol support: basic db commands

v0.3: Now I want it on my LAN
=============================

Resolver shim (external c++/qtwebkit wrapper around js resolvers, w/ unified stdout API)

v0.4: Browser oh baby
=====================
HTTP API

v0.5: Get talking
=================
