Ono
===

Ono is a headless [http://www.gettomahawk.com][Tomahawk] daemon. It scans your music, talks to other Tomahawks 
on the network (and in the future will support Jabber and Twitter SIP). 

It is written in Clojure, and was is my attempt to get familiar with the language.

Usage
=====

For ease of use, download the uberjar from TODO.

If you wish to compile it yourself, clone the repo and run it with `lein trampoline run`.
